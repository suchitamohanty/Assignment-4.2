      "I saw what you did, and please don't think I'm a nut case, but it restored my faith in the human race."
      Oh, the things people do! The woman who climbs up the two flights of stairs at the train station, then climbs back
      down them to help an old man with his suitcase. The strange little man who walks around downtown slipping packages
      of cookies into the bags of the sleeping homeless people. The guy who picks up the public trash can on the corner that
      fell over. Everybody walking by notices these tiny kindnesses. So few will take the socially risky, even embarrassing step
      of approaching the complete stranger who's done them and thanking him or her for what they're really doingâ€”helping us remember that,
      despite the constant headlines, human beings don't just invent Ponzi schemes and burn up the ozone. They also offer to share
      their umbrellas with strangers during pouring thunderstorms, even if it means their backpack will be a little wet.
